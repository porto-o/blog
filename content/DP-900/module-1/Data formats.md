# What is data?
---
To begin with DP-900 preparation, let's define data. Data is a **collection of facts** from real world objects. For example, numbers from school grades, descriptions from hotel reviews, observations, etc. This data is stored by organizations to **get useful information that could help improving the company**.

## How we store it?
The most common way to organize data is by using **entities** that can have one or more **attributes**.

> Example:
>
> The entity 'Customer' may have the following attributes:
> 	1. name
> 	2. address
> 	3. phone number

## Structured Data
Structured data is when the **data has a fixed schema**, so all the data have the **same fields or properties**. Commonly, we use tabular format for structured data.

In relational model, we can **relate multiple tables using key values**.

## Semi-structured data
Data that has some structure, the records **can have the same attributes or not**. The most common way of representation is by using JSON documents.

For instance, a customer can have **_phone and email for contact_**, while other might just have **_email_**.

## Unstructured data

Data in raw format, **without structure**. For example, images, audio, music, video, etc.

_INSERT IMAGE_

## Conclusion

There is not such a thing as “better data” since every organization store data in these different ways. For instance, to record transactions.

There are **two broad** categories of data store in common use:

1. File stores (Next topic)
2. Databases
