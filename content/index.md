# Hi! I'm Ismael and this is my **blog** 😁

Here you can find some of my nerdy notes. For instance, right now I'm working on DP-900 certification notes.

These are my personal notes, so there might be errors.

For DP-900 notes, start [[Data formats|here]]

For Advanced databases college course notes, start [[Introduction to NoSQL Systems|here]]
